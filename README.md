# Go Opportunities API

This is a simple job opportunities API built with Go, inspired by the project **arthur404dev/gopportunities**. I used it mainly to learn and practice Go concepts like routing, database interaction, and structured project layout.

Original project: [arthur404dev/gopportunities](https://github.com/arthur404dev/gopportunities)

##  Features
- RESTful API using Go and the Gin router
- SQLite database for local storage
- GORM for ORM and database operations
- Simple CRUD endpoints: Create, Read, Update, Delete job opportunities

## Notes

- I used this project as a learning exercise to explore Go fundamentals, such as API routing with Gin, ORM design with GORM, and database handling with SQLite.
- It's simple by design, focusing on clarity and practical learning rather than production readiness.
